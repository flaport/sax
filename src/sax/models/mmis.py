    This function models an ideal 1x2 MMI splitter that divides input power
    between two output ports. The model is implemented as an ideal splitter
    and represents the theoretical limit of MMI splitter performance.

    MMI devices use multimode interference in a wide waveguide to achieve
    power splitting through self-imaging effects. This ideal model assumes
    perfect operation without considering the detailed physics of multimode
    propagation.

        coupling: Power coupling ratio between 0 and 1. Determines the fraction
            of input power that couples to the second output port (out1).

            - coupling=1.0: All power to out1

    Returns:

        print(f"Output powers: {power_out0:.3f}, {power_out1:.3f}")

        Asymmetric MMI splitter:

        This is an idealized model that assumes:
        - Perfect power conservation
        - No wavelength dependence
        - No reflection or insertion loss
        - Ideal multimode interference

        Real MMI devices exhibit wavelength-dependent behavior, finite bandwidth,
