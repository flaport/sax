    r"""Ideal 2x2 directional coupler model.

    This function models an ideal 2x2 directional coupler with perfect coupling
    efficiency and no loss. The coupler divides input power between two output
    ports based on the coupling coefficient, with a 90-degree phase shift
    between cross-coupled terms to maintain unitarity.

    The coupler has four ports arranged as:
    - Input ports: in0, in1 (left side)
    - Output ports: out0, out1 (right side)

    Power coupling behavior:
    - Fraction (1-coupling) transmits straight through (bar state)
    - Fraction coupling is cross-coupled between arms
    - Total power is conserved across all ports

    Args:
        coupling: Power coupling coefficient between 0 and 1. Determines the
            fraction of power that couples between the two waveguide arms.
            - coupling=0.0: No coupling (straight transmission)
            - coupling=0.5: 3dB coupler (equal bar/cross transmission)
            - coupling=1.0: Complete cross-coupling
            Defaults to 0.5.

    Returns:
        The coupler s-matrix

    Examples:
        3dB coupler (equal splitting):

        ```python
        import sax

        s_matrix = sax.models.coupler_ideal(coupling=0.5)
        # Bar transmission (straight through)
        bar_power = abs(s_matrix[("in0", "out0")]) ** 2
        # Cross transmission (between arms)
        cross_power = abs(s_matrix[("in0", "out1")]) ** 2
        print(f"Bar power: {bar_power:.3f}")  # Should be 0.5
        print(f"Cross power: {cross_power:.3f}")  # Should be 0.5
        ```

        Asymmetric coupler:

        ```python
        s_matrix = sax.models.coupler_ideal(coupling=0.1)  # 10% coupling
        bar_power = abs(s_matrix[("in0", "out0")]) ** 2  # Should be 0.9
        cross_power = abs(s_matrix[("in0", "out1")]) ** 2  # Should be 0.1
        ```

        Phase relationship verification:

        ```python
        s_matrix = sax.models.coupler_ideal(coupling=0.5)
        bar_phase = jnp.angle(s_matrix[("in0", "out0")])
        cross_phase = jnp.angle(s_matrix[("in0", "out1")])
        phase_diff = cross_phase - bar_phase
        print(f"Phase difference: {phase_diff:.3f} rad")  # Should be π/2
        ```

    Note:
        This is an idealized lossless model that assumes:
        - Perfect power conservation (unitary S-matrix)
        - No reflection at any port
        - Wavelength-independent behavior
        - Symmetric coupling between both directions

        The 90-degree phase shift in cross-coupled terms (1j factor) is required
        for maintaining S-matrix unitarity and represents the physical phase
        relationship in evanescent coupling.
